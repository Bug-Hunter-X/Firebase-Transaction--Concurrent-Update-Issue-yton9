# Firebase Realtime Database Transaction: Concurrent Update Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential issue when using Firebase's Realtime Database transactions and how to correctly handle concurrent updates to prevent unexpected data inconsistencies.  The problem occurs when a transaction's callback function doesn't properly account for data changes that might have occurred between the time the transaction started and the time it's committed.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file shows an example where a counter is incremented using a transaction. However, the implementation fails to account for the possibility of another client updating the counter concurrently.  This can lead to incorrect results where the counter isn't accurately incremented.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation where the transaction callback checks if the data has changed since the transaction started. If it has, the transaction is aborted and the operation is retried.
